## Welcome to My GitHub Profile üëã

Hi, I'm Daniela Martinez, an emerging Data Scientist with a background in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applied in the agricultural field. I have experience working with large spatial datasets containing diverse variables, ranging from socioeconomic conditions to weather data, and I have implemented tools such as ArcGIS and SQL to extract valuable insights for decision-making in sustainability.

I believe that integrating GIS and Data Science methodologies can lead to better decisions with positive impacts on climate change and social justice by making data-driven decisions. This approach guided me to enrich my career within the realm of Data Science, where I gained hands-on experience in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning models. I am excited to apply these skills to drive meaningful progress in this evolving field.

### üíº **Professional Background**


- **GIS and Natural Resources Management Expertise**: Extensive experience in GIS analysis, natural resources management, and land administration.

- **Advancing Analytical and Programming Proficiency**: Refined skills through comprehensive training at BrainStation and a Specialization in Geomatics.

- **Projects & Achievements**: identified the most vulnerable areas prone to contamination by vinasse in underground water and established various levels of protection in natural resource management across specific areas spanning over 20,000 hectares and developed a machine learning model using various algorithms to classify wine quality. My role included model selection, evaluation, and addressing class imbalance to improve accuracy and precision in the classification.

### üõ†  **Technical Skills**

- **ArcGis**: experienced in generating maps, performing spatial analysis, and managing geospatial data.
- **SQL**: skilled in data querying and manipulation.
- **Python**: competent in using Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning; familiar with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- **R**: capable in statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Tableau**: experienced in creating insightful visual analytics.

### ‚ö° **Passions**
Nature, rock climbing and the insights numbers provide!

### üîç **Interests**
